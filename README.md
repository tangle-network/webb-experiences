## Overview
Webb's software is open-source by default so should its product development. This repo aims to  provide transparency, promote community collaboration, and gather immediate feedback throughout Webb's product stack development lifecycle. In this repo you will find a collection of product related material, illustrations, documents, and analysis.

We are motivated to build amazing products for our community, to deliver a seamless experience and to deeply understand our users needs. This is a dedicated space aimed at achieving those goals, where users can provide feedback, inspiration, and even contribute to Webb's product stack.
