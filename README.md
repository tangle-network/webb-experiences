### Overview 📖
Webb's software is open-source by default so should its product development. This repo aims to  provide transparency, promote community collaboration, and gather immediate feedback throughout Webb's product stack development lifecycle. In this repo you will find a collection of product related material, illustrations, documents, and analysis.

We are motivated to build amazing products for our community, to deliver a seamless experience and to deeply understand our users needs. This is a dedicated space aimed at achieving those goals, where users can provide feedback, inspiration, and even contribute to Webb's product stack.

### Webb Ecosystem Vision 👓

The vision for the Webb ecosystem is to empower developers to build interoperable privacy preserving applications with incredible ease. To achieve this vision we have built a private bridge system called the
Webb Anchor Protocol.  

The intended purpose of the Webb Anchor Protocol is to enable developers to build their own cross-chain, zero-knowledge applications on top of. The first application of this kind is Webb's transfer asset protocol which allows users to move private assets across EVM and Substrate chains using zero-knowledge proofs and a configurable token re-wrapping system. We intend to support additional chains to extend users ability to privately move assets in the future. For additional insights into Webb's product vision check out our [vision board!](./vision-board.md).
