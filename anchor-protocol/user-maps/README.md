# Overview

The purpose of the following user maps act as a visual representation of a users experience with Webb's products. These illustrations tell a story about how a user flows through each phase of interaction and experiences each phase. The user maps include touch-points, user sentiment, such as frustration or confusion, and any opportunities we can improve upon.

### What is a user journey map?

The process of mapping their journey encourages and reminds us to consider the entire user experience: their feelings, questions and needs while they interact with Webb's products. Itâ€™s used for understanding and addressing user needs and pain points. What is the user thinking about and what are they hoping to achieve?
